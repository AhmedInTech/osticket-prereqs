First thing you would want to do is to create an Azure subscription. At the time of writing, Azure comes with a free $200 credit which is more than enough for this project. Once you are in your screen should look something like this. Do not mind the Resource Group section because since you just created an account you will have to create your own resource group.

Once you're in now you want to create a resource group and two virtual machines, one running windows 10 and the other running ubuntu. This step is pretty straightforward, and also make sure you remember the username and password you created for your virtual machine, as it will be important soon.
